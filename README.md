To run the app please follow the steps below:

## 1. Install dependencies

In the project directory, run `npm install` to install the required dependencies

## 2. Run the app in development mode.

Run `npm start`

This script is configured to run mock server and the react app concurrently
- Mock API will run at http://localhost:5000
- React APP will run at http://localhost:3000

##

Currently the app is not configured to run in the production as it requires post build scripts to run the mock server and serve the react app.
